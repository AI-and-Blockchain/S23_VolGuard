# VolGuard âŒ±

> Mitigate  high volatility in DeFi markets using AI-powered market
makers.

## Overview

Defi is infamous for having high volatility, in large part due to the
small and sporadic number of transactions in varying sizes. Traditional 
Financial markets have a continuous stream of market orders, largely 
facilitated by entities such as High Frequency Trading firms. VolGuard 
aims to reduce the volatile and sproadic nature of the DeFi markets by
using ML-driven market maker contracts, which attempt to predict future 
volatility and brace against it before it occurs.

VolGuard ingests DeFi data from protocols such as Uniswap, and
generates an off-chain AI prediction of future volatility. Based on this 
prediction, a smart contract system is invoked to deploy a corresponding
strategy that best capitalizes on the anticipated market conditions.

## System Vision

The vision behind VolGuard is to create an easy-to-use predictive market
making system that users can deploy and self-host in a completely decentralized
mannner, allowing many different users to participate, modify, or create 
new methods for reducing volatility in DeFi markets.

## Setup
### Installation
1. Create new folder and clone repository into folder using:

```
git clone https://github.com/AI-and-Blockchain/S23_VolGuard.git
```

2. Install dependencies via the following pip command:
```
pip install scikit-learn torch pandas numpy parquet pyarrow plotly Flask matplotlib
```

### ML Predictions


3. Run hourlyHistorical.py with node to fill historical_files with csv data
```
python3 hourlyHistorical.py
```

4. Run the app.py file to spin up the local flask instance, and make a call to URL(/data) to get latest values or URL(/predict) to get the latest daily volatility prediction.

### Blockchain Oracle Communication

5. Deploy Oracle/contract/oracle.sol to a testnet of your choice, and copy its address.

6. Run Oracle/service/CentralizedOracle.js, feeding in the URL(/predict) and your oracle address in order for that data to be passed to the oracle smart contract.
